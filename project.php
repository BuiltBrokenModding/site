                        Core Engine system used by calcalvia and at one point our modding team. Around Jan 1, 2015 we cloned RE to create our own version of the engine. This action was taken to better support the needs of our modding team. The project is still on going and owned by calcalvia.

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        UE was the dream to create a common compatibility steam for  all minecraft mods. The API was originally created by calcalvia for ICBM. Mainly to avoid Industrial Craft 2 strict guidelines on API usage. It developed into a power system with the joint efforts of our team. However, the dream was short lived being deprecated in 1.7.10 in favour of creating an in house power system for RE.

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        Originally one of our join projects between calcalvia and our team. We stopped supporting the mod near the end of 2014 when our designs were conflicting with calclavia's designs to much. The mod itself adds micro brick gears, wires, and various mutli block machines. It is still on going but we do not keep track of the progress.

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        Was one of the original Universal Electricity mods, and part of a mod called steam power. FM was split off aiming at fluid support for UE based mods. Most of the content from the mod was merged into Resonant Induction. The goal was to reduce our work load while increasing the support for our users. The tank, pipe, gutter, drain, pump, and fluid blocks in RI come from this mod. The mod is currently dead but there are plans to bring it back.

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        Created for the UE-Api as both an example and a simple machine mod. It was decommissions with parts being merged into several mods. Resonant induction and Resonant Engine picked up a few of these pieces. Galaticraft's machines were derived from this project though they have changed a bit since then. Basic components itself was decommissioned after a mod called Mekanism was released to replace its need.
