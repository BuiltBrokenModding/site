                        We all have that guy up the road we just want to nuke. You know the one who keeps firing his TNT cannons thinking he is the king of war. With ICBM not only is he out match you can get that wish you always wanted.

                        When you close your eyes at night all you can think about is redstone? Good, you have come to the right place. We too have become addicted to the power of redstone and have made it even more powerful. Giving redstone all those detectors, manipulators, and cool machines it always needed.

                        Tired of every mod having its own ores, ingots, gears, chips, parts, etc. We are just as tired of you so we created Voltz Engine to solve the issue. Well at least on our side of the modding universe. Each one of our large content mods uses voltz engine to provide all the replicated content that every mod needs. Without each mod having the same content over and over and over again.

                        Miss those good old days when automation was king. When a single block and a row of pipes didn't do everything. We miss those days as well and have revived the mod assembly line to solve the issue. Assembly line is the soul of automation as it truly should have been. Using conveyor belts, robotics, and world based machines to create everything you need.</p>

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        Minecraft truly has a lack of weapons and armor. Even when considering the wide range of mods that have attacked the subject. Only providing replications of modern weapons or overpowered armor. With Armory, we hope to approach the subject from a different direction. Starting with a diverse upgrade and modification system for everything in the mod. Then hitting every single tech age that mankind has gone threw in the real world. Followed by adding anything and everything imagined in the pages of fiction. Along with this, we want to truly added a crafting system that will make players feel like they have created a masterpiece. Not just lumping ingots into a fireplace getting a piece of a sword. No, we want the player to feel like his work was something to have pride in before stabbing a zombie.</p>

                        Sometimes the world is dull and empty. With cows that go moo and zombies that are too dumb to walk. Many times we have tried to solve this with more content, better AIs, and other mods. Each time it is like a fix that only lasts a few days. Artillects is the solution we have been working on for a while to solve this. It introduces a robotic hive race as part of the world, not just in the world. This means that the mobs are not just dumb AIs following basic tasks. Each entity will act like a living create and interact with everything around it. This will include the player to a high extent but is not always the case. As the drones, of the robotic race, may ignore the player as yet another object in the world. Making it feel like the player is not longer the center of the world he has created. Giving a new perspective on what the world can be as the drones will build, live, and die without the player's involvement. However, when the player does get involved things can get very fun. As the artillects were also created as a hostile challenge for all those shiny toys in the player's armory.  </p>

                       Ah, those good old days of being in a workshop with motor oil on your hands and a creation coming to life. Oh, never had that experience well don't worry it is not a requirement. Tinker Toys is our attempt to provide the player with the chance to build robots with endless modifications.   </p>

                       What is the point of having guns, armor, tanks, planes, missiles, and all the good old stuff in a boring base? Military base decor provides all the missing pieces to make your base look like a military base. Don't worry it is not just for looks. It provides all the defense while still giving you the exact look you want. Who knows maybe it will look so nice your enemy will not nuke you; but, if it does feel safe in knowing it will outlast even the strongest of bombs.</p>

                        Core Engine system used by calcalvia and at one point our modding team. Around Jan 1, 2015 we cloned RE to create our own version of the engine. This action was taken to better support the needs of our modding team. The project is still on going and owned by calcalvia.

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        UE was the dream to create a common compatibility steam for  all minecraft mods. The API was originally created by calcalvia for ICBM. Mainly to avoid Industrial Craft 2 strict guidelines on API usage. It developed into a power system with the joint efforts of our team. However, the dream was short lived being deprecated in 1.7.10 in favour of creating an in house power system for RE.

                    <p style="padding:0em 1em;"> 
                        Originally one of our join projects between calcalvia and our team. We stopped supporting the mod near the end of 2014 when our designs were conflicting with calclavia's designs to much. The mod itself adds micro brick gears, wires, and various mutli block machines. It is still on going but we do not keep track of the progress.

                        Was one of the original Universal Electricity mods, and part of a mod called steam power. FM was split off aiming at fluid support for UE based mods. Most of the content from the mod was merged into Resonant Induction. The goal was to reduce our work load while increasing the support for our users. The tank, pipe, gutter, drain, pump, and fluid blocks in RI come from this mod. The mod is currently dead but there are plans to bring it back.

                        Created for the UE-Api as both an example and a simple machine mod. It was decommissions with parts being merged into several mods. Resonant induction and Resonant Engine picked up a few of these pieces. Galaticraft's machines were derived from this project though they have changed a bit since then. Basic components itself was decommissioned after a mod called Mekanism was released to replace its need.

                        Original created by out asset developer hangcow it was picked up and support by our modding team. It was let go after our team couldn't find time to maintain the mod. Before it was let got the mod added locked chests, locked doors, electric fence, laser fence, reinforced blocks, traps, and other useful security features.

                        Created by Elrath18 and hangcow this mod added colored glass, and other decoration blocks to minecraft. After several MC updates and other mods with the same idea it was let go. With the new 1.8 updated adding coloured glass the idea to revive it has been completely forgotten.

                        Sub mod for ICBM that added automated and player mounted weapon platforms. Included cannon, laser, rail, and AA sentry gun. Was decommissioned during the 1.7 update of ICBM in order to spread the content into other mods. Most likely will be recreated in both Tinker toys and Artillects.

                        Created back in the beta days of MC this mod added simple NPC guards. The mod was continues up to 1.4.7 were the project files were lost. Rather than recoding the project from scratch it was abandoned. Concepts from the mod will be added to artillects. Which will include the NPC, barracks, and armory systems.

It also includes basic ore and item generation that was similiar to Resonant Engines auto generation system.
