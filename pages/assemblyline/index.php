    <p>Assembly use to be a mod created back in 1.5.2 that added factory themed content to minecraft. In 1.6.4 it was merged into the mod Resonant Induction. With the continued issues and removal of content from Resonant Induction the mod will be revived. The plan is to bring it back in 1.7.10 later on in 2015 when ICBM is completed.</p>
