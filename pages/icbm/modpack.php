        <h2>Public Pack Permissions</h2>
        <p> If you are requesting for a version older than Minecraft 1.7.10 then you don't need to ask for permission. Since we don't support the older versions your free to use them in any modpack. That is as long as you follow the same rules required for any other modpack. </p>
        </br>
        <p>For anything newer you need to request permission from one of our team members. You can find their contact info on the contact page. As well be prepared to answer a few questions about the modpack you are creating. </p>

        <h2>Private Pack Permissions</h2>
        <p>If your running a pack that is private and only for your friends you have permission. Like other pack types you are still required to follow the same rules. We also suggest you read the difference between public and private packs bellow.</p>

        <h2> How to keep your Permissions</h2>
        <p> Once you have permission to add the mod to a pack you need to follow a few rules. Failure to follow our rules will result in your permissions being revoke. </p>
        <h4> Rules </h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-left:5%;">
        <li> Give credit to the team </li>
        <li> Provide a link to ICBM page </li>
        <li> Have permissions for other mods</li>
        <li> Make no profit off the pack</li>
        <li> Follow Minecraft EULA </li>
        </ul>

        <h2> Difference Between Pack Types</h2>
        <p> Other than what mods a pack contains there are set types for packs. Public packs are any pack that can be downloaded from a site without restriction. This also includes any pack that is hosted threw a launcher. In which the launcher can be downloaded, and installed. </p>
        </br>
        <p> Private modpacks are packs that are used for a small group of people or a small server. In which the download is hidden and not shared publicly. The size to be considered small is up to about 30 people. Anything larger than this is considered a public server or group of people. In which the pack is also considered to be public as it is being distributed commonly enough.</p>
