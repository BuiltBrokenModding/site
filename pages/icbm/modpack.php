        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>If you have permissions your modpack and name will be listed <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13SXh1AeaJx07Tt4MXCg-Kz5mNxXLI-ilShrIZlSC8E8/edit#gid=0">here</a></p>

        <h2>Public Pack Permissions</h2>
        <p> Permissions are very simple to get and easy to keep. Just make sure you read everything bellow and follow our guidelines.</p>
        </br>
        <p>For any version older than Minecraft 1.7.10 you can include ICBM in any modpack. You still need to follow our rules down bellow as we can still revoke your permissions. As well make sure to not send any bug reports to us about older versions. We no longer support these versions due to major changes in the code.</p> 
        </br>
        <p>For versions 1.7.10 and up you need to get permissions from one of the team members. As well you can email modpack@builtbroken.com to request permission. We will try to answer any email with in a week or so. When you do email make sure to tell us the name of the pack, your name, what your pack is about, the mods in the pack, and any other important info. If you include a URL to the pack we will post it on our website so your pack gets more traffic. </p>

        <h2>Private Pack Permissions</h2>
        <p>If your running a pack that is private and only for your friends you have permission. Like other pack types you are still required to follow the same rules. We also suggest you read the difference between public and private packs bellow.</p>

        <h2> How to keep your Permissions</h2>
        <p> Once you have permission to add the mod to a pack you need to follow a few rules. Failure to follow our rules will result in your permissions being revoke. </p>
        <h4> Rules </h4>
        <ul style="list-style-type: upper-roman; padding-left:5%;">
        <li> Give credit to the team </li>
        <li> Provide a link to ICBM page </li>
        <li> Have permissions for other mods</li>
        <li> Make no profit off the pack</li>
        <li> Follow Minecraft EULA </li>
        </ul>
        
    </div>

        <h2> Difference Between Pack Types</h2>
        <p> Other than what mods a pack contains there are set types for packs. Public packs are any pack that can be downloaded from a site without restriction. This also includes any pack that is hosted threw a launcher. In which the launcher can be downloaded, and installed. </p>
        </br>
        <p> Private modpacks are packs that are used for a small group of people or a small server. In which the download is hidden and not shared publicly. The size to be considered small is up to about 30 people. Anything larger than this is considered a public server or group of people. In which the pack is also considered to be public as it is being distributed commonly enough.</p>
