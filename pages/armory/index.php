        <p> Armory is a planned addition to our mod list that has no plan to be released any time soon. The mod when created will focus on armor, weapons, and combat. It will feature several different ages of weapons. Including different ways to make, use, and display all of the content. Each age will also feature configs to allow customization for modpacks. This includes the ability to turn weapon ages off and turn content off.</p>
