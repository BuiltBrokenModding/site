    <h2> What to do? </h2>
    <p>First thing to do is read our FAQ section for common issues. Unless your issue is very new or rare it will be listed so everyone knows what to do. If your issue is not listed in the FAQs then keep reading so you know how to report an issue.</p>
    

    <h3> #1 Access the issue area </h3>
    <p> For the moment we handle our issue reports threw our code repo on github. To access this click the github menu button at the top of the page. It will take you to the site and the issue page. If it fails to take you to the issue area then navigate the links on the page. One of them should read issue and is most likely on the left side.</p>
    <p> Once you have found the issue area take some time to read threw the issue. This way you can check to make sure someone else has not already reported the issue. As any duplicate issue will be closed and linked to the first issue created. 

    <h3> #2A If you find an existing Issue</h3>
    <p>You have a few options if you find a report matching your issue. First thing to do is log in to github and watch the issue. This way github will email you when the status changes. After this if you feel it is important leave a reply to the issue. Include any extra information and what you think is wrong. If you are a mod dev or programmer you are even welcome to fix the issue. </p>

    <h3> #2B Issue is closed but not fixed</h3>
    <p> First you need to check why the report was close to avoid issues reponing the repo. Bellow are some common reasons and what to do for each reason.
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Marked as 'Duplicate Issue'</strong></br> <p>Go to the original post which should be linked in the page</p></li>
    <li><strong>Marked as 'Will Not Fix'</strong></br> <p>Either the problem is rare, not cause by our mod, or obsolete in newer versions</p></li>
    <li><strong>Marked as 'Fixed'</strong></br>  <p>If your using the latest version, and at least a day has passed you can reopen the issue. Make sure to provide as much information as possible so we can reopen the investigation into the bug. Ensure to provide the current version your using, core mod version your using, other mods, java version, OS version, and a new crash report if applies. In other words treat it like it was a new bug report. This way we don't have to waste your time asking for the information later.</p></li> 
    </ul>
    </p>
    
    <h3> #2C New Issue Report</h3>
    <p>Once you have done everything listed above you can post a new issue report. To do this go to our github issue area and click 'new issue'. From here fill out the title with a quick name for the issue. Make sure that it matches the issue you submitted. Some good examples of a title are 'Server Side Runtime crash', 'Small Rocket - Explodes on Launch', or 'Can't Craft Small Warhead Casing'</p>

    <h2>[FAQ]Frequently Answered Questions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: I'm using an older version can you still help?</h4>
            <p>A: With our limited staff we only support one Minecrft version at a time.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: Some items/blocks are missing?</h4>
            <p>A: If your using a 1.6.4 version or older then check to make sure the ids in the config are the same. If they change they will cause things to go missing. If your using a newer version then make sure the names of the items didn't change. To do this read threw the change log of the mod in question. If it notes the item names have changed this will cause the items to vanish. There are tools that can be used to correct this but we suggest just spawning items to replace the missing ones.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: Names are not localized?</h4>
            <p>A: If your using one of the languages we support and this is happening then report it as a bug. If not then we are sorry most of our team only speaks english. Meaning we do not have the ability to translate the game into another language. We do however accept volunteer translations as long as the person translating is creditable</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: Some Textures are missing?</h4>
            <p>A: From time to time texture name get messed up causing this to happen. As well when we add new items sometimes we don't have the textures right away. This is especially the case if your using beta or alpha versions of the release. In which we don't patch up visual issues until we go to release an official build.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: All the Textures are missing?</h4>
            <p>A: Most likely a bad build, download the jar again. If this doesn't work try a different build and report the build as bad.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: My bug report has not been answered?</h4>
            <p>A: Some days we don't have the time to read or answer every bug report. If this happens don't worry we will end up answering the bug report. It may just take a few days or weeks depending on what is currently on the TODO list. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: Game didn't load with the mod?</h4>
            <p>A: There are a few things that could cause this namely you didn't install the mod. To check this make sure that modName.jar is inside your mods folder. If it is in the mods folder where MC is installed then check to see if forge is installed. You can do this by seeing if you have a mods button when you load up MC. If you have no button go to http://www.minecraftforge.net/ for help installing forge. If forge is not the issue then look threw the output log forge generates. Look for anything that says skipping mod, file, or anything that would suggest the mod didn't load. If this is the case take a zip file opener and open the mod jar. If it is empty or doesn't contain any .class files then it is a bad file. Try to redownload the file to see if it got corrupted when downloaded. If it is still broke then report the file is bad threw a bug report and try a different version. We will check the file ourselves and remove it off the site. </p>

            <h4>Q: Minecraft says i'm missing Voltz Engine?</h4>
            <p>A: Most of our mods require that voltz engine be installed to function. It not only does most of the work it also contains most of our functionality and crafting items. Without it not only will the mod not work but even if it did nothing could be used. You can download voltz engine <a href="/pages/voltzengine/">here</a></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Q: My Anti-virus alerts me that ModName.jar contains a virus?</h4>
            <p>A: As long as you downloaded ModName.jar from this site and not somewhere else you should be fine. If your Anti-virus keeps alerting you then either your anti-virus is bad or something is wrong. You may need to consult your settings in your anti-virus if this also happens with any jar. As some anti-virus don't like java programs doing anything other than sitting doing nothing. If you don't trust the download after doing this then we suggest not to use it. Best thing to always do is play is safe and report the problem to our developers.</p>
