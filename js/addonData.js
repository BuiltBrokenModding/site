	"title":"Artillects",
	"description":"Destroyer of Worlds. Mainly Artillects is setup as an anything-everything mod to prevent restricting what can be created. The foundation however is setup to focus on creating a wide range of non-player characters(NPC). These character are aimed at acting more or less like real living creatures. They will eat, sleep, talk, trade, work, and do what you normally will. For you as the player, or even tech player, these may not sound like much more than sims. However, the npcs are setup to allow for survival mode game play. You can trade with them for food, buy gear, and get them to do hard labor for you. Especially in the cases where you need to automate complex setups. For example reloading, and then aiming a missile at your buddies base with a payload of supplies.

	"title":"ICBM-Classic",
	"description":"ICBM doesn't need much explanation of what it is or isn't. After all, ICBMs are super sizes missiles that blow everything up. Making this mod just about destroying the world right? I would say no but its a mixed story when it comes to ICBM. At the beginning, it was created with the idea that PvP needed a modern addition. Fewer swords, guns, traps, and more bang for your resources. Since its creation, it has evolved to support more than a PvP environment. Adding in cargo missile to transport items across the world. Weather missiles to control the climate and condition of the world. Transportation missiles to allow the player to take a one-way taxi back to his base. That is just the beginning of that is to come as the mod continues to evolve. "
