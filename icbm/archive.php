    <h2>!!NOTICE!!</h2>
    <p>Documentation and support for old version is going to be non-existent. This is mainly due to no documentation existing for older versions. As well do not report issues for older versions as we do not have the ability to provide fixes for old versions.</p>

    <h2>Modpack permissions</h2>
    <p> If a version of ICBM has been placed into the archive then its fair game for a modpack. This means you have permission to use it in any modpack. That is as long as you follow the latest modpack permissions guide lines. This will include giving credit to the team and complying with our no profit guidelines. </p>
